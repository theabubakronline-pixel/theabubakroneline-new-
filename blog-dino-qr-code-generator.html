            <div class="feature-box">

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How to Make QR Code with Logo: Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <p>Let me walk you through exactly how to create your first QR code with logo. It's simpler than you think, and you'll have a branded QR code in under a minute.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Enter Your Content</h3>
            <p>Start by entering what you want your QR code to link to. This could be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A website URL (to <strong>make QR code for website</strong>)</li>
                <li>A link to your social media profile</li>
                <li>A location (to <strong>make QR code for location</strong>)</li>
                <li>Plain text or contact information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Choose Your Design</h3>
            <p>Here's where it gets fun. You have two main options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dinosaur Theme:</strong> Select from 10 unique dinosaur templates. Each one has distinct shapes and patterns that make your QR code visually interesting.</li>
                <li><strong>Logo Upload:</strong> Click the upload button and select your logo image. The tool automatically centers it in the middle of your QR code.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 3: Customize Colors</h3>
            <p>Make it yours. Choose custom colors for both the foreground and background. You can use preset color schemes or create your own with the color picker. This is especially useful when you want your QR code to match your brand colors.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 4: Preview and Download</h3>
            <p>See your QR code update in real-time as you make changes. Once you're happy with it, download it as a high-quality PNG or SVG. The download matches your preview exactly, so what you see is what you get.</p>
            
            <p>That's it! You've just learned <strong>how to create QR code with logo</strong> in four simple steps. No technical skills required, no payment needed, and no account to create.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to Make QR Code for Website</h3>
            <p>To <strong>make QR code for website</strong>, enter your full website URL (including https://). I recommend adding your logo to make it more professional and recognizable. This helps with branding and makes people more likely to scan it, knowing it's from your business.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Make QR Code for Location</h3>
            <p>Want to <strong>make QR code for location</strong>? Enter a Google Maps URL or location coordinates. When someone scans the QR code, it will open the location in their maps app. Perfect for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store locations on business cards</li>
                <li>Event venues on invitations</li>
                <li>Tourist attractions or landmarks</li>
                <li>Delivery addresses or meeting points</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For location QR codes, I suggest using a clear, simple design since they're often used in practical situations where quick scanning is important.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Features: QR Code with Image Generator</h2>
            <p>Beyond just logos, this tool functions as a full <strong>qr code with image generator</strong>. Here's what that means:</p>
            
            <h3>Logo Integration</h3>
            <p>The most common use is adding your logo to create a <strong>qr code with logo in the middle</strong>. The tool automatically handles the positioning and ensures the QR code remains scannable. You can use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Company logos</li>
                <li>Personal photos</li>
                <li>Brand icons</li>
                <li>Event graphics</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Image Backgrounds</h3>
            <p>While the primary feature is logos in the center, the color customization allows you to create QR codes that match your brand or design aesthetic. This makes your QR codes feel like a natural part of your visual identity.</p>
            
            <h3>Dinosaur Image Integration</h3>
            <p>The dinosaur templates themselves use image-like patterns integrated into the QR code structure. This is unique to this tool—you won't find this level of visual integration in other <strong>qr code with image generator free</strong> tools.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're looking for a <strong>qr code with image in the middle</strong> (logo) or a <strong>qr code with image background</strong> (color customization), this tool gives you the flexibility to create exactly what you need.</p>

            <h2>Technical Details: How It Works</h2>
            <p>You might be curious about the technical side of things. Let me explain how this <strong>dino qr code generator app</strong> maintains scannability while adding custom designs:</p>
            
            <h3>Error Correction Technology</h3>
            <p>QR codes use error correction to remain readable even if part of the code is damaged or obscured. This tool uses Level H error correction, which means up to 30% of the QR code can be modified or covered while still remaining scannable. This is what allows us to integrate dinosaur shapes and logos without breaking functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>Smart Pattern Integration</h3>
            <p>The dinosaur shapes aren't randomly placed. They're strategically integrated into the QR code pattern, replacing certain modules while maintaining the code's structural integrity. This requires careful calculation to ensure the QR code remains valid and scannable.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-Time Validation</h3>
            <p>As you customize your QR code, the tool validates it in real-time to ensure it remains scannable. You'll see visual feedback confirming that your QR code is working correctly, so you never have to guess whether it will scan.</p>
            
            <p>This technical sophistication is what sets this apart from basic <strong>online qr code generator</strong> tools. We've put in the work to make sure your creative QR codes actually work.</p>

            <h2>Comparing to Other QR Code Generators</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering how this compares to other <strong>free qr code generator online</strong> tools. Let me be honest with you:</p>
            
            <h3>Most Free Tools Are Basic</h3>
            <p>Most <strong>qr code generator free</strong> tools give you a basic black and white square. That's it. No customization, no branding options, no personality. They work, but they're boring.</p>
            
            <h3>Premium Tools Cost Money</h3>
            <p>Tools that offer logo uploads and customization usually charge monthly fees or per-QR-code costs. For businesses creating multiple QR codes, this can add up quickly.</p>
            
            <h3>This Tool: Best of Both Worlds</h3>
            <p>This <strong>dino qr code generator free</strong> tool gives you premium features at no cost. You get:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logo upload (usually a paid feature)</li>
                <li>Custom colors (usually a paid feature)</li>
                <li>Unique dinosaur themes (completely unique to this tool)</li>
                <li>High-quality downloads (usually a paid feature)</li>
                <li>No watermarks (usually added to free tools)</li>
                <li>Unlimited use (usually limited in free tools)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>It's like having a premium <strong>branded qr code generator</strong> without the premium price tag.</p>
